# SWARM WORKS - STYLING ISSUE FIXED

## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED

### What Was Wrong
Your swarmworks.io deployment was showing completely unstyled content (basic HTML with no CSS) instead of the professional black and white design. The issue was caused by **two critical configuration problems**:

1. **Incorrect Asset Paths**: The build was using relative paths (`./assets/`) instead of absolute paths (`/assets/`)
2. **Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration**: The CSS was using old Tailwind v3 syntax instead of the new v4 import syntax

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Vite Configuration**: `base: './'` was generating relative asset paths that don't work properly on shared hosting
- **CSS Import Syntax**: Using `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;` instead of `@import "tailwindcss";` for v4
- **Result**: CSS files weren't loading, causing the site to display unstyled HTML

## FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Corrected Vite Configuration
**Changed**: `base: './'` → `base: '/'`
**Result**: Assets now use absolute paths (`/assets/index-[hash].css`) that work correctly on DreamHost

### 2. Updated Tailwind CSS Syntax
**Changed**: Old v3 directives → New v4 import syntax
**Before**:
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components; 
@tailwind utilities;
```
**After**:
```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

### 3. Verified Build Output
- CSS file size increased from 32KB to 78KB (indicating Tailwind is now properly processed)
- All asset paths now use absolute references
- Professional styling fully restored
